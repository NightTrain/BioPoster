Lotka-Volterra equations

    Assumptions

        Prey population always has food
        Predator food supply is only prey
        Population growth is proportional to size
        Environment is static
        Predators always eat

    dx/dt = x(\alpha - \beta y)
    dy/dt = -y(\gamma - \delta x)

    x = # prey
    y = # predators

    \alpha = prey growth rate (without predation)
    \beta = predation rate
    \gamma = predator death rate (without prey)
    \delta = predator growth rate (through predation)

Predator: orca whale
Prey: seal

**Interactions**

Interactions are partly based on equation, partly based on what the grid
model makes practical.

None -> None: Nothing happens.

None -> Prey: Prey moves.

None -> Predator: Predator moves.

Prey -> None: Prey might reproduce.

Prey -> Prey: Nothing happens.

Prey -> Predator: Prey might be eaten. Predator might die. If prey is eaten
predator might reproduce.

Predator -> None: Predator might die.

Predator -> Prey: Prey might be eaten. Predator might die. If prey is eaten
predator might reproduce.

Predator -> Predator: Predator might die.
