Lotka-Volterra equations

    Assumptions

        Prey population always has food
        Predator food supply is only prey
        Population growth is proportional to size
        Environment is static
        Predators always eat

    dx/dt = x(\alpha - \beta y)
    dy/dt = -y(\gamma - \delta x)

    x = # prey
    y = # predators

    \alpha = prey growth rate (without predation)
    \beta = predation rate
    \gamma = predator death rate (without prey)
    \delta = predator growth rate (through predation)

Predator: orca whale
Prey: seal
